Hey I'm Vinayak. I'm a senior at CSUMB studying Computer Science and communication design :desktop_computer: :paintbrush:  
I'm actively seeking Software Developer jobs as a fresher.  
I'm a UI UX Engineer, and I enjoy learning about the intersection of visual design and computer science. I love to create smooth and fluid user experiences that are accessible by everyone :iphone:  
I use GitHub for college submissions and project repos  <br>
